# Component Alternatives: ESC Stage

Supply chain redundancy guide, and the single home for ESC-stage alternative research in this repo. **Historical snapshot (2026-03-14, MCU/CSA/passive sections 2026-03-17)**, baselined on the pre-refresh ESC BOM of the 20x20 source board (now [OpenESC-20x20](https://github.com/OpenDrone-hw/OpenESC-20x20)): SP40N03GNJ FETs, U3/U7/U9/U11 gate-driver refdes. The committed design now uses **DOY180N03T** (C49441966, 30 V, PowerDI3333-8) FETs; current stock, prices and risks are in [SOURCING-2026-06.md](SOURCING-2026-06.md), which supersedes every stock and price figure below. The gate-driver pinout compatibility notes remain valid (NSG2065Q unchanged). Pin-compatibility claims refer to the pre-refresh layout.

## Gate Drivers (QFN-24, 4x4mm)

All FD6288Q-family clones share **identical pinout** with the NSG2065Q. No PCB changes needed.

| Pin | Function |
|-----|----------|
| 1-3 | LIN1-3 (low-side inputs) |
| 4 | VCC (5-20V supply) |
| 5 | NC (MODE on DRV8300) |
| 6 | COM/GND |
| 7-8 | NC |
| 9-11 | LO3-LO1 (low-side outputs) |
| 12-14 | VS3, HO3, VB3 (phase 3 high-side) |
| 15-17 | VS2, HO2, VB2 (phase 2 high-side) |
| 18-20 | VS1, HO1, VB1 (phase 1 high-side) |
| 21 | NC (DT on DRV8300) |
| 22-24 | HIN1-3 (high-side inputs) |
| EP | GND |

### DRV8300 (TI) - Layout-Compatible with Caveats

| Part | LCSC | Stock | Price |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| **DRV8300DRGER** | C3655801 | 53 | $0.38 |

Pin differences vs FD6288Q family:
- **Pin 5 = MODE** (internal 200k pulldown → floats to non-inverting = same behavior as FD6288 family). **Safe to leave NC.**
- **Pin 21 = DT** (floating = fixed ~215ns deadtime). **Safe to leave NC.**
- Source current only 750mA (vs 1.5A on most clones) - slower MOSFET turn-on
- Max 100V (vs 250V on FD6288 family) - fine for LiPo, less transient headroom
- LCSC stock is terrible (53 units)

**Verdict:** Works on the same pads, no PCB changes needed. Not recommended as primary due to low stock and weaker drive. Good as emergency fallback.

### FD6288Q (Fortior, original) - Discontinued

All QFN-24 variants OOS on LCSC. Only FD6288T (TSSOP-20, C97683, 34k stock) available - wrong package.

### NSG20652Q - NOT Compatible

QFN-24 4x4mm but **completely different pinout** with added SD pin. For 30x30 variant only (separate repo/board).

## MOSFETs - 20x20 Variant (3x3mm / 3.3x3.3mm DFN-8)

Part at the time of this snapshot: **SP40N03GNJ** (C22466709), 40V, 75A, 2.9mΩ, $0.10. The committed design has since moved to **DOY180N03T** (C49441966).

### 40V Alternatives - Sorted by Performance

| Part | LCSC | Mfg | RDS(on) | Id | Pkg (mm) | Stock | Price |
|------|------|-----|---------|----|----------|-------|-------|
| **BSZ018N04LS6** | C534643 | Infineon | **1.8mΩ** | 158A | 3.3x3.3 | 935 | $0.81 |
| **NCEP4065QU** | C502974 | Wuxi NCE | **2.2mΩ** | 65A | 3.1x3.2 | **6,152** | $0.44 |
| **AON7140** | C2758662 | AOS | **2.3mΩ** | 148A | 3.3x3.3 | 3,767 | $0.96 |

| **BSZ028N04LS** | C534649 | Infineon | 2.8mΩ | 40A | 3.3x3.3 | 1,595 | $0.88 |
| **SP40N03GNJ** | C22466709 | Siliup | 2.9mΩ | 75A | 3.0x3.0 | 2,125 | **$0.10** |

### 30V Premium Alternative - FDMC8010DC

| Part | LCSC | Mfg | RDS(on) | Id | Qg | Pkg (mm) | Stock | Price |
|------|------|-----|---------|----|-----|----------|-------|-------|
| **FDMC8010DC** | C555489 | onsemi | **1.28mΩ@10V** | 157A | 67nC | PQFN-8 (3.3x3.3) | 2,965 | $0.90 |

**Trade-offs vs SP40N03GNJ:**
- **56% lower RDS(on)** - 1.28mΩ vs 2.9mΩ. Per-phase MOSFET loss drops from 5.8mΩ (2×2.9) to 2.56mΩ (2×1.28)
- **36% lower total phase resistance** - ~5.8mΩ vs ~9.0mΩ including ~3.2mΩ copper (3mm wide × 10mm, 1oz)
- **9× more expensive** - $0.90 vs $0.10 per FET, $21.60 vs $2.40 for all 24
- **30V Vds** - max 7S LiPo (29.4V) vs 40V on SP40N03GNJ which handles 8S+ with margin. Limits battery voltage headroom and transient margin on 6S
- **3.3x3.3mm package** - was a footprint change from the 3.0x3.0mm POWERPAK-1212-8 used at the time of this snapshot
- **Higher Qg** (67nC vs ~35nC) - more gate charge means slightly higher switching losses, partially offsets conduction gains at high PWM frequencies

**Verdict:** Advertise as an optional premium build for users who want maximum efficiency on 3-6S and are willing to pay more. Not the default due to cost and reduced voltage headroom. Needed a footprint change to 3.3x3.3mm PQFN-8 at the time; the schematic has since moved to a 3.3x3.3mm land pattern anyway.

### Other 30V Low-RDS Alternatives (3.3x3.3mm DFN-8)

| Part | LCSC | Mfg | RDS(on) | Id | Qg | Stock | Price |
|------|------|-----|---------|----|-----|-------|-------|
| **BSZ0901NS** | C534685 | Infineon | **1.7mΩ@10V** | 145A | 23nC | 4,035 | $0.74 |
| **NCEP3065QU** | C502964 | Wuxi NCE | **1.9mΩ@10V** | 65A | 34.8nC | 2,356 | $0.40 |
| **BSZ019N03LS** | C152374 | Infineon | 1.9mΩ@10V | 22A | - | 2,654 | $1.25 |

All 30V parts share the same trade-off: lower RDS(on) but reduced voltage headroom (max 7S), and all use a 3.3x3.3mm footprint.

### Verify Footprint Fit

At the time of this snapshot the footprint was POWERPAK-1212-8, 3.0x3.0mm, so every 3.3x3.3mm part listed above counted as a footprint change. The committed schematic has since moved to `Package_SON:Diodes_PowerDI3333-8` (3.3x3.3mm) for the DOY180N03T, though the committed PCB still places the 3.0x3.0mm pattern. Either way, pad pitch and layout differ between 3.3mm parts. **Check datasheets before assuming drop-in compatibility with 3.3mm parts.**

### Ohmic Loss Analysis (3mm trace width, 10mm trace length, 1oz copper, 80°C)

Per-phase current path: copper (bat + GND ≈ 3.2mΩ) + 2 MOSFETs (high + low side).

**SP40N03GNJ @ 35A (1oz):**

| Loss Source | Resistance | Power |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| 2x MOSFET (2.9mΩ each) | 5.8 mΩ | 7.1W (64%) |
| Copper (bat + GND) | 3.2 mΩ | 3.9W (36%) |
| **Total** | **9.0 mΩ** | **11.0W** |

**FDMC8010DC @ 35A (1oz):**

| Loss Source | Resistance | Power |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| 2x MOSFET (1.28mΩ each) | 2.56 mΩ | 3.1W (44%) |
| Copper (bat + GND) | 3.2 mΩ | 3.9W (56%) |
| **Total** | **5.8 mΩ** | **7.1W** |

FDMC8010DC saves ~3.9W per phase at 35A (36% reduction). MOSFETs are the dominant loss in both cases on this board geometry. 2oz outer copper (JLCPCB supports 2oz/2oz outers on 6-layer) would further reduce copper losses but requires all B.Cu traces to meet 0.15mm minimum width.

## MOSFETs - 30x30 Variant (larger packages OK)

### PSMN1R6-40YLC (Nexperia) - Target Part

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Vds | 40V |
| RDS(on) | **1.25mΩ** @10V, **1.55mΩ** @4.5V |
| Id | 100A |
| Qg | 59nC @4.5V |
| Package | **LFPAK56 (5x6mm)** - NOT 3x3mm |
| LCSC | **Not stocked** |

**Status: Discontinued/unavailable on LCSC.** Closest available:

| Part | LCSC | RDS(on) | Qg | Stock | Price |
|------|------|---------|----|-------|-------|
| PSMN1R8-40YLC | C88071 | 1.8mΩ @4.5V | 45nC | 94 | $1.33 |
| PSMN1R5-40YSDX | C553230 | 1.5mΩ @10V | 99nC | 50 | - |

Stock is terrible for all Nexperia 40V LFPAK56 on LCSC. May need to source from DigiKey/Mouser for the 30x30 variant, or find Chinese equivalents in LFPAK56.

## ESC MCU and Current Sense Amp

Carried over from the 2026-03-17 cost study of the same pre-refresh BOM. Stock and price figures are from that date; current figures are in [SOURCING-2026-06.md](SOURCING-2026-06.md).

### MCU: AT32F421G8U7 - KEEP

Cheapest AM32-compatible MCU in QFN-28 4x4mm at ~$0.475/unit at the time.
- GD32E230G8U6TR ($0.448) has only 8KB SRAM, insufficient against the 16KB requirement
- STM32G071G8U6 ($0.78) is 65% more expensive
- No alternative is pin-compatible; switching requires a full board redesign

### Current Sense Amp: INA186A3IDCKR - MONITOR

Stock is the standing risk (74 units on LCSC at 2026-03-17, and still under 1k in the JLC library at 2026-06-12). No Chinese clones exist.
- INA199A2DCKR (C131913): $0.248 (52% cheaper), same SC-70-6 footprint, 909 stock, bidirectional, zero-drift, but **26V common-mode limit**, tight for 6S at 25.2V with no transient margin
- INA180A3IDBVR (C122882): $0.154 (70% cheaper), SOT-23-5 so a different footprint, unidirectional only, 4,875 stock
- 3PEAK TP181A2-CR (C2902350): $0.10, SC-70-6, 36V CM, INA199 pinout, was OOS; monitor for restock
- For V1: source INA186A3 via JLCPCB global sourcing. For V2: consider INA199A2 if the 26V common-mode limit is acceptable

### Buck: LMR51420YDDCR family

Applies to the 20x20 source board, not to the committed OpenAIO design. OpenAIO's instantiated bucks are two LMR51430YFDDCR on the FC power sheet; the LMR54406DBVR ESC buck sits in the un-instantiated `esc_main` sheet. Kept because the constraint still holds: at 36V input the SOT-23-6 options are thin.
- LMR51420XDDCR (C5246146, 500kHz variant): pin-compatible, $0.82
- LMR51420YFDDCR (C7296200, JLCPCB variant): pin-compatible, $0.72
- AOZ1282CI (C111916): $0.22, 36V, but only 1.2A and a different pinout, so it needs PCB rework
- AP63200 family: $0.20-0.41, 2A, but only 32V max, unsafe for 6S with transients

### Passive Optimizations

All 0201 parts are Extended; JLCPCB has no 0201 Basic parts. Drop-in swaps identified at the time, each worth verifying against the actual rail voltage first:

| Swap | From -> To | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 100nF 0201 35V -> 6.3V | C181043 -> C76928 | Murata, safe for 3.3V/5V decoupling |
| 22uF 0402 | C105226 -> C415703 | Murata, same voltage, 63% cheaper |
| 22uF 0603 16V -> 6.3V | C2762594 -> C59461 | Samsung, Basic part. Verify voltage rail |
| Shunt redesign | 0.2mOhm -> 2mOhm + INA186A1 | Requires a CSA gain change |

Combined these were ~5% of that BOM, so they are a last-pass optimization, not a lever.

## Design Changes for Universal Gate Driver Support

**State at the time of this snapshot:** Pins 5, 7, 8, 21 are NC with no copper on all 4 gate driver instances (U3, U7, U9, U11). VCC on +8V, COM/EP on GND.

**Required changes: NONE.** That PCB already supported all listed gate drivers:
- FD6288Q clones: Pins 5/7/8/21 = NC → no conflict
- DRV8300: Pin 5 (MODE) floats low via internal pulldown → non-inverting (correct). Pin 21 (DT) floating → fixed 215ns deadtime (acceptable)
- All signal pins (1-3, 9-20, 22-24) are functionally identical across all parts

**Optional improvement:** Add unpopulated 0402 resistor pad from pin 21 to GND. This enables variable deadtime when using DRV8300 without affecting other drivers. Low priority.
