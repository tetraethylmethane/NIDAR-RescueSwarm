The project is named `4in1`, not after the repo. Renaming it would break the
fab archive names, the release assets and the website board art, so it stays.

## Rules

Identical in every OpenDrone board repo. Do not edit here; edit the template.

- **Never text-edit** `.kicad_sch`, `.kicad_pcb` or `.kicad_dru`. Use KiCad, or
  kicad-skip / the pcbnew API for scripted changes. `.kicad_pro` is JSON and may
  be edited directly for metadata.
- **Metadata yes, connections no.** An agent may write BOM and documentation
  fields (MPN, Manufacturer, LCSC, Cost, Datasheet, text variables). An agent
  may not change nets, wiring, routing, placement, footprint assignment, or any
  value that changes the circuit.
- **Close KiCad before any write to a KiCad file.** KiCad caches library tables
  at process start and overwrites files on save.
- **Reuse before you draw.** Check the `OpenDrone` library and its
  `PARTS-USED.md` first. If the part is there we have already sourced,
  footprinted and shipped it, and its symbol links to the exact committed
  datasheet: place it from `OpenDrone`. Draw a new part only when the catalogue
  has nothing that fits, and import it with `easyeda2kicad` from its LCSC
  number. Pulling a newer catalogue is a deliberate, reviewed submodule commit.
- **One person holds a board layout at a time.** KiCad files do not merge. Say
  on Discord that you are taking it. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Run ERC and DRC before every pull request.** Existing approved findings
  may remain; a new type or increased count must be reviewed before merge.

## Environment

```sh
# schematic and board checks
kicad-cli sch erc hardware/4in1.kicad_sch
kicad-cli pcb drc --schematic-parity --refill-zones hardware/4in1.kicad_pcb

# netlist, for scripted analysis
kicad-cli sch export netlist --format kicadsexpr -o /tmp/4in1.net hardware/4in1.kicad_sch
```

Reusable scripts (renders, STEP export, packaging art) come from Incutec
hardware tooling; the OpenDrone release standard lives in OpenDrone-hw/.github/RELEASES.md;
board-specific scripts live in hardware/tools/.

## Architecture

Four independent channels share one power input and one connector. Per channel:
an **AT32F421G8U7** (Cortex-M4, QFN-28) drives an **NSG2065Q** three-phase
half-bridge gate driver, which drives six **SP40N01GHNK** MOSFETs, two per
phase. One channel is drawn once in `ESC.kicad_sch` and instantiated four times.

Current sensing is **board level, not per motor**: a single INA186A3IDCKR at 100
V/V sits across two 0.2 mOhm 2512 shunts in parallel, 0.1 mOhm total, in the
+BATT feed. That gives 10 mV/A and roughly 330 A full scale against a 3.3 V ADC,
reported as `/CURR`.

## Connectors and I/O

Betaflight Standard:

| Pin | Net | Function |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | +BATT | Battery positive |
| 2 | GND | Ground |
| 3 | /CURR | Current sense telemetry, INA186 output |
| 4 | unconnected | See below |
| 5 | /M1 | DShot, channel 1 |
| 6 | /M2 | DShot, channel 2 |
| 7 | /M3 | DShot, channel 3 |
| 8 | /M4 | DShot, channel 4 |

Pin 4 is the dedicated telemetry pin in the Betaflight 8-pin standard and is
intentionally left unconnected: ESC to FC telemetry rides the motor signal lines
over bidirectional extended DShot instead.

## Firmware

AM32 first needs a boatloader loaded using an ST-LINK
(AM32_F421_BOOTLOADER_PB4_V19.hex) firmware is flashed and configured in-browser
at am32.ca. Works with Betaflight and any other DShot-capable flight controller.

## Layout rules

Bulk decoupling on +BATT and GND exists on the PCB without matching schematic
symbols. That is a deliberate board-only bank. Do not run update-from-schematic
without checking what it would delete.

## Revisions

| Rev3.3 | 2026-08-25 | Export `OpenESC-30x30-rev3.3. `Silkscreen rebranded OpenDrone -> incutec for export restriction reasons on flagging anything containing 'Drone'. First Incutec production run. |
| Rev3.2 | 2026-08-22 | Export `OpenESC-30x30-rev3.2`. Matched input network at the current-sense amplifier (R89/R90 1k, C40/C41 100n 50V, C42 1u) against the high-side common-mode feedthrough. |
