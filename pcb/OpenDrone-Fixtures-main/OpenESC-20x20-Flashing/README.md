# 20x20-ESC-Flashing: AM32 SWD flashing station

SWD flashing jig for the **OpenESC-20x20** (`../../OpenESC-20x20/hardware/4in1-mini`). 100 x 100 mm,
4 layer, ten 1.2 mm SMD pogo pins, four ST-LINK breakout headers, 4 mm banana
jacks for target power, M3 corners. Fabbed as `20x20-flashing-V0.1`.

Pogo pins land on the ESC's B.Cu face: `/SWD1_CLK` … `/SWD4_CLK` on each
channel's PA14 test point, `/SWD1_DIO` … `/SWD4_DIO` on PA13, plus `/VBAT` and
`GND` on the battery pads so the target is powered while flashing.

The 30x30 version is `../OpenESC-30x30-Flashing`, a copy of this board with
the pogo pins moved.

## Flashing

SWD once per MCU to clear readout protection and write the AM32 bootloader, then
firmware and settings over the DShot signal pin. Host side is
`../../OpenESC-20x20/hardware/flash_openesc20.sh`: OpenOCD, AT32F421 FAP unlock, program and
verify bootloader plus firmware, `--loop` to auto-flash the next board on ST-LINK
reconnect.
