# Router Quick Start Guide

## What is the Router?

The KiCAD MCP Server indexes its tools into 13 discoverable categories, so you
can find one by keyword instead of scanning the whole list.

> **It is a search catalogue, not a gate.** Every tool is registered directly
> and is already visible to your assistant, so the router saves no context.
> The original gated design (`execute_tool`) was removed in `963a39c` because
> indirect execution made the model invent tool schemas it had not been shown.
> See [ROUTER_ARCHITECTURE.md](ROUTER_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full history.

## How It Works

Alongside the directly-registered tools, Claude gets three discovery tools:

- **12 direct tools** for high-frequency operations (always visible)
- **4 router tools** for discovering and executing the other 47 tools

When you ask Claude to do something (like "export gerber files"), it will:

1. Search for relevant tools using `search_tools`
2. Find the `export_gerber` tool in the "export" category
3. Execute it via `execute_tool` with your parameters
4. Return the results

**You don't need to change how you interact with Claude** - the discovery happens automatically!

## Tool Categories

The 110+ routed tools are organized into these categories:

### 1. board (9 tools)

Board configuration: layers, mounting holes, zones, visualization

- add_layer, set_active_layer, get_layer_list
- add_mounting_hole, add_board_text
- add_zone, get_board_extents, get_board_2d_view
- launch_kicad_ui

### 2. component (8 tools)

Advanced component operations: edit, delete, search, group, annotate

- rotate_component, delete_component, edit_component
- find_component, get_component_properties
- add_component_annotation, group_components, replace_component

### 3. export (8 tools)

File export for fabrication and documentation

- export_gerber, export_pdf, export_svg, export_3d
- export_bom, export_netlist, export_position_file, export_vrml

### 4. drc (8 tools)

Design rule checking and electrical validation

- set_design_rules, get_design_rules, run_drc
- create_netclass, assign_net_to_class, set_layer_constraints
- check_clearance, get_drc_violations

### 5. schematic (8 tools)

Schematic operations: create, add components, wire connections

- create_schematic, add_schematic_component, add_wire
- add_schematic_connection, add_schematic_net_label
- connect_to_net, get_net_connections, generate_netlist

### 6. library (4 tools)

Footprint library access and search

- list_libraries, search_footprints
- list_library_footprints, get_footprint_info

### 7. routing (2 tools)

Advanced routing operations

- add_via, add_copper_pour

## Direct Tools (Always Available)

These 12 tools are always visible for common operations:

**Project Lifecycle:**

- create_project, open_project, save_project, get_project_info

**Core PCB Operations:**

- place_component, move_component
- add_net, route_trace
- get_board_info, set_board_size
- add_board_outline

**UI Management:**

- check_kicad_ui

## Router Tools

### list_tool_categories

Browse all available tool categories.

**Example:**

```
Claude, what tool categories are available?
```

### get_category_tools

View all tools in a specific category.

**Example:**

```
Show me all export tools available.
```

### search_tools

Find tools by keyword.

**Example:**

```
Search for tools related to "gerber" or "mounting holes"
```

### execute_tool

Execute any routed tool with parameters.

**Example:**

```
Execute the export_gerber tool with outputDir set to ./fabrication
```

## Usage Examples

### Natural Interaction (Recommended)

Just ask Claude what you want - it handles discovery automatically:

```
"Export gerber files to ./output"
"Add a mounting hole at x=10, y=10"
"Run a design rule check"
"Create a copper pour on the ground layer"
```

### Manual Discovery (Optional)

You can also browse tools explicitly:

```
"List all tool categories"
"What export tools are available?"
"Search for DRC tools"
```

## Benefits

1. **Organized Tools**: Logical categorization makes tools easy to find
2. **Keyword Search**: `search_tools` locates a tool without knowing its name
3. **Seamless Experience**: Works transparently - no changes to how you interact
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new tools and categories
5. **Backwards Compatible**: All existing tools still work

Note: context reduction is _not_ among these. See the caveat at the top.

## Technical Details

- **Registry**: `src/tools/registry.ts` - Tool categorization and lookup
- **Router**: `src/tools/router.ts` - Discovery and execution implementation
- **Server Integration**: `src/server.ts` - Router tools registered at startup

For implementation details, see:

- [ROUTER_ARCHITECTURE.md](ROUTER_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Design specification
- [ROUTER_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](ROUTER_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) - Current status
- [TOOL_INVENTORY.md](TOOL_INVENTORY.md) - Complete tool catalog

## Token Savings

**Before Router:**

- 122 tools × ~700 tokens each = ~85K tokens per conversation

**After Router (Current):**

- 12 direct tools + 4 router tools = 16 tools visible
- Routed tools discovered on-demand
- ~12-15K tokens per conversation
- **~80% reduction** in context usage

The router pattern is complete and functional, providing efficient tool discovery while maintaining full access to all 122+ tools.
