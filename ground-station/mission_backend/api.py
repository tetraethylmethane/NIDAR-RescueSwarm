"""Flask app factory with the SYS-20 module split.

SYS-20: "GCS shall be incapable of originating a retask, waypoint change or drop
command by construction", verified by source review. Abort and recall are exempt
— permitted by 8.16 and required by 8.19.

The mechanism is deliberately structural rather than a feature flag. In mission
mode the command blueprint is **never imported and never registered**, so there
is no route to reach. `test_sys20.py` asserts this against the live URL map, so
the requirement is checked by CI on every push rather than by someone
remembering to look.

  create_app(mission_mode=True)   -> mission build.  Telemetry + abort/recall.
  create_app(mission_mode=False)  -> dev build.      Everything, for flight test.
